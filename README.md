**ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Marvin**

I'm a french software developer loving testing automation and trying my best to focus on ethical solutions. Mostly building products with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

I used to build [Strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/) and [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) in a previous life.

Secretly dreaming of becoming an IT teacher.
