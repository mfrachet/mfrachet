**ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Marvin Frachet**

I'm a french software developer reconverted from the "hype" to ethical and inclusive programming.

I'm mostly building products, with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). I love testing automation and I'm trying my best to provide valid experience to people.

I'm actually working on some pieces of [Strapi]((https://github.com/strapi)), a Headless CMS, and used to work on building [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

I secretly dream of becoming an IT teacher.
